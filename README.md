 All publicly available algorithm codes that have been posted as content are in this repo.

## Getting Started with the Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of various algorithms, primarily implemented in Python. To contribute or run the code, you'll need to have Python installed on your system.

1. Installing Python
Choose your operating system and follow the instructions below to install Python. It's recommended to use Python 3.9 or newer.

On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. You can check the version by running python3 --version. If you need to install or update it, use the following commands:

```Bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
To ensure the correct package manager is also installed, run:
```
```Bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
On macOS
macOS also typically has a version of Python pre-installed. However, it's often an older version. It's best to install a modern version using a package manager like Homebrew.
```
Install Homebrew: Open your terminal and run the command from the Homebrew website.

Install Python: After Homebrew is installed, run:

```Bash

brew install python
This will install the latest stable version of Python.
```
On Windows
Download Python: Go to the official Python website.

Run the Installer: Download and run the executable installer.

Important: On the first screen of the installer, make sure to check the box that says "Add python.exe to PATH" before clicking "Install Now". This makes it easy to run Python from the command line. .

2. Running the Code
Once you have Python installed, you can run any of the .py files in the repository directly from your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the file's directory. For example, to run the fractaltree.py file, use the following command:

```Bash

cd Algorithms
Run the Python script using the python3 command (on Linux/macOS) or python command (on Windows):
```
```Bash

python3 fractaltree.py
```
or

```Bash

python fractaltree.py```
